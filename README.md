Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator for everyone. 

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement of a person’s weight with respect to their height. It is more of an indicator than a direct measurement of a person’s total body fat. 
BMI, more often than not, correlates with total body fat. This means that as the BMI score increases, so does a person’s total body fat. 
The WHO defines an adult who has a BMI between 25 and 29.9 as overweight - an adult who has a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese - a BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight, and between 18.5 to 24.9 a healthy weight. 
BMI is used to assess a person’s health risks associated with obesity and overweight or underweight. 

<b>BMI Calculator </b> is one of the tools that are used to calculate healthy risk. Other factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, blood sugar level, family history of heart disease, age, gender, waist circumference, level of physical activity, menopause status, smoking status, etc. are also taken into consideration while assessing health risk.
